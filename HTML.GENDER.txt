<h1>Solution for gender issues in middle ages focused on men's dominance over women</h1>

<p>Gender is shaped by the society in which an individual lives, it is critical to investigate and evaluate the implications of being male or female in particular historical contexts. Because of the strict roles that restricted women to the home sphere and men to the public sphere, the Middle Ages are frequently characterized as patriarchal societies. Feudal society, characterized by the three orders of society (those who pray, fight, and work), was dominated by men. To be viewed as manly, men had to project dominance over women, the military, and authority. While it is known that women made interventions within these social orders, it is also certain that they were excluded from the hierarchy and kept in the private sphere.</p> 

<p>Solution: our solution is 
•Education and Awareness: Disrupt conventional narratives that uphold men's dominance by using approachable methods to spread knowledge about gender equality in the Middle Ages.

•Assure equitable access to learning.
•Give women more clout at work.
•Preserve the right to procreate.
•bolster the legal safeguards.
•Give better health care.
•Improve your representation in politics.
•Give priority to the most disadvantaged.</p> 

<p>Our solution is effective and relevant according to http://hdl.handle.net/10342/1701 because this helped the people in middle ages to stop the discrimination to both genders. 

Here's our research about that, and proofs:

Legal and Policy Changes: Track the adoption of laws and policies that are meant to bring about gender parity. Progress would be demonstrated by specific modifications to the laws pertaining to inheritance, property rights, and protection from gender-based violence. 

Monitor advancements in women's educational attainment and access. A positive influence on questioning conventional gender roles would be suggested by rising female enrollment and educational attainment.

Assess the proportion of women occupying leadership positions in communities, places of worship, and other domains to discern a change in the balance of power.

And one more thing, through their writings, some academics and reformers, like Christine de Pizan challenged conventional gender roles. Furthermore, within the confines of religious doctrine, some medieval Christian movements promoted more equal treatment of women. It's crucial to remember that progress was gradual rather than the product of a single solution, and that societal attitudes varied greatly.</p>
